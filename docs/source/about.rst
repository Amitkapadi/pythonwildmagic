About |NAME|
************

|NAME| is a Python wrapper of Wild Magic C++ libraries, written on Linux by Velimir Mlaker using several freely available softwares:

Wild Magic 5.7
==============
  
  This is the awsome |WM_DESCR|.
  The source code is generously made freely downloadable from
  `www.geometrictools.com <http://www.geometrictools.com>`_.

Python 2
========

  The wrapper is developed with Python language of version
  somewhere in the range of 2.6 and 2.7.
  Any recent version of Python 2 should work (but not so sure
  about Python 3.)

SWIG
====
  
  The `SWIG <http://www.swig.org>`_ 
  interface compiler wraps
  C++ libraries into Python API.

GCC-XML
=======

  Analysis of the C++ libraries is done with help of
  `GCC-XML <http://www.gccxml.org>`_, the XML 
  output extension to GCC.

|NAME| is an open source Google Code project at
`python-wild-magic.googlecode.com <http://python-wild-magic.googlecode.com>`_.

.. The end.
