About |NAME|
************

|NAME| is an open source Google Code project at
`python-wild-magic.googlecode.com <http://python-wild-magic.googlecode.com>`_.
It's a wrapper code written on Linux by Velimir Mlaker using 
several freely available softwares:

Wild Magic 5.7
==============
  
  This is the awsome C++ library for real-time computer graphics and 
  physics, mathematics, geometry, numerical analysis, and image analysis.
  The source code is generously made freely downloadable from
  `www.geometrictools.com <http://www.geometrictools.com>`_.

Python 2
========

  The extension is developed with Python language of version
  somewhere in the range of 2.6 and 2.7.
  Any recent version of Python 2 should work (but not so sure
  about Python 3.)

SWIG
====
  
  The `SWIG <http://www.swig.org>`_ 
  interface compiler wraps
  C++ libraries into Python API.

GCC-XML
=======

  Analysis of the C++ libraries is done with help of
  `GCC-XML <http://www.gccxml.org>`_, the XML 
  output extension to GCC.

.. The end.
